# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt confident going through it. From some of the self-learning I had to do in challenges, I was familiar with going through the problem-solving steps.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Revisiting when my work isn't progressing has been very helpful. Getting "stuck" hasn't happened too often (yet)
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
Being able to self-teach concepts going into the lectures.
